# CorLife Front End Coding Exercise

Welcome!

We have the following tasks for you to attempt. You'll find each task marked as a TODO in the codebase. If you're using webstorm, you can find these using the TODO find. 
Feel free to add any comments to the tasks below; if you found anything particularly challenging, for example.

First fork this repo, clone it, install any dependencies and run on either the iOS Simulator, Android Emulator or a real device.

Next, try to add a commit per task and then open a pull request into your main branch, so we can more easily see your changes.

Once you've finished, send a link to the fork back to us.

You don't need to spend more than a couple of hours on this and don't worry about completing everything.
